- Run `bun compile` on the @terminal to check for Elm compiler errors
- Run `bun lint` on the @terminal for linting Elm files and fix errors
- Run `bun run test` on the @terminal for testing your changes
- Use Elm v0.19.1 when generating Elm code
- Minimize usage of external dependencies
- Check the #problems tab to resolve issues
- Create small reusable functions
- Keep the `update` function clean and readable
- Keep indentation low by using ELm's pipeline operator |>
